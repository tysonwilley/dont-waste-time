#Don't Waste Time

Super simple little thing inspired by [Tim Urban's TED Talk about procrastination](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/my-ted-talk.html).

Put in your birthdate, it tells you how many weeks you've lived and how many you
might have left based on a 90 year life.

###Notes

- I used this as an opportunity to flex some Vanilla JS muscles
- There is no consideration for browser prefixes, graceful degradation, or Blue Es
- Styling is bland and boring
